This depends upon a number of external modules inculding `Plots` and `Turing`.  The simplest way to ensure all needed packages are installed is to navigate into the `Math_T880_2022` folder and activate its environment by entering the package manager (type the `]` key), and then 
```
(@v1.7) pkg> activate .
(Math_T880_2022) pkg> 
(Math_T880_2022) pkg> up
```
The last command, `up`, will ensure that all neccessary packages are installed in the local environment.  As this only makes changes to the `Math_T880_2022`, none of your other files will be disrupted.
